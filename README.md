# Integrating Scroll L2 with React

This repository contains the code for a simple implementation of an web3 provider for Ethers.js, Wagmi &  on a React App. 

You can run this repo via doing `npm start` and test it out yourself!

## Prerequisites

Before you can interact and work with Scroll L2, you will have to register your EOA wallet address to be whitelisted for access to the pre-alpha testnet.

Check in after a few days and it should be approved. You can then use the faucet to get some tokens to pay gas fees on the testnet.
